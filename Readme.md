##### Support Vector Machine
    1. Supervised Learning Algorithm.
    2. Classification method in ML.
        - Separates data using "Hyperplane" (2d or a plane in 3d).
        - Separates the two categories in the sense that it maximizes the distance to points in either category this  distance is called the "margin".
    3. SVMs can work with very small datasets and are not prone to overfitting.
    4. It solves the convex optimization problem.
    5. easy to understand.
    6. easy to implement.
    7. easy to interpret.
    8. Effective when training "dataset is small".
    9. Ex: 
        i.   Face Detection
        ii.  Spam Filtering
        iii. Text Recognition
        iv.  Stock Market Prediction
        v.   Image Classifier
